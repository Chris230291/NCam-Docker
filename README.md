## Supported Architectures

We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker [here](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md#manifest-list) and our announcement [here](https://blog.linuxserver.io/2019/02/21/the-lsio-pipeline-project/).

Simply pulling `chris230291/ncam:latest` should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags.

The architectures supported by this image are:

| Architecture | Available | Tag |
| :----: | :----: | ---- |
| x86-64 | ✅ | amd64-\<version tag\> |
| arm64 | ✅ | arm64v8-\<version tag\> |
| armhf| ✅ | arm32v7-\<version tag\> |

## Application Setup

To set up ncam there are numerous guides on the internet. There are too many scenarios to make a quick guide.
The web interface is at port 8181.

## Usage

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

### docker-compose (recommended, [click here for more info](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/docker-compose))

```yaml
---
version: "2.1"
services:
  ncam:
    image: chris230291/ncam:latest
    container_name: ncam
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/London
    volumes:
      - /path/to/data:/config
    ports:
      - 8181:8181
    devices:
      - /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### docker cli ([click here for more info](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/))

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=ncam \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e TZ=Europe/London \
  -p 8181:8181 \
  -v /path/to/data:/config \
  --device /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  chris230291/ncam:latest
```

### Passing through Smart Card Readers

If you want to pass through a smart card reader, you need to specify the reader with the `--device=` tag. The method used depends on how the reader is recognized.
The first is /dev/ttyUSBX. To find the correct device, connect the reader and run `dmesg | tail` on the host. In the output you will find /dev/ttyUSBX, where X is the number of the device. If this is the first reader you connect to your host, it will be /dev/ttyUSB0. If you add one more it will be /dev/ttyUSB1.

If there are no /dev/ttyUSBX device in `dmesg | tail`, you have to use the USB bus path. It will look similar to the below.

`/dev/bus/usb/001/001`

The important parts are the two numbers in the end. The first one is the Bus number, the second is the Device number. To find the Bus and Device number you have to run `lsusb` on the host, then find your USB device in the list and note the Bus and Device numbers.

Here is an example of how to find the Bus and Device. The output of the lsusb command is below.

`Bus 002 Device 005: ID 076b:6622 OmniKey AG CardMan 6121`

The first number, the Bus, is 002. The second number, the Device, is 005. This will look like below in the `--device=` tag.

`--device=/dev/bus/usb/002/005`

If you have multiple smart card readers, you add one `--device=` tag for each reader.

## Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-p 8181` | WebUI |
| `-e PUID=1000` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `-e PGID=1000` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `-e TZ=Europe/London` | Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London. |
| `-v /config` | Where ncam should store config files and logs. |
| `--device /dev/ttyUSB0` | For passing through smart card readers. |

## Environment variables from files (Docker secrets)

You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend `FILE__`.

As an example:

```bash
-e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword
```

Will set the environment variable `PASSWORD` based on the contents of the `/run/secrets/mysecretpassword` file.

## Umask for running applications

For all of our images we provide the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional `-e UMASK=022` setting.
Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask) before asking for support.

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```bash
  $ id username
    uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup)
```

## Support Info

* Shell access whilst the container is running: `docker exec -it ncam /bin/bash`
* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime: `docker logs -f ncam`
* container version number
  * `docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' ncam`
* image version number
  * `docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' chris230291/ncam:latest`

## Updating Info

Most of our images are static, versioned, and require an image update and container recreation to update the app inside. With some exceptions (ie. nextcloud, plex), we do not recommend or support updating apps inside the container. Please consult the [Application Setup](#application-setup) section above to see if it is recommended for the image.

Below are the instructions for updating containers:

### Via Docker Compose

* Update all images: `docker-compose pull`
  * or update a single image: `docker-compose pull ncam`
* Let compose update all containers as necessary: `docker-compose up -d`
  * or update a single container: `docker-compose up -d ncam`
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

### Via Docker Run

* Update the image: `docker pull chris230291/ncam:latest`
* Stop the running container: `docker stop ncam`
* Delete the container: `docker rm ncam`
* Recreate a new container with the same docker run parameters as instructed above (if mapped correctly to a host folder, your `/config` folder and settings will be preserved)
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

### Via Watchtower auto-updater (only use if you don't remember the original parameters)

* Pull the latest image at its tag and replace it with the same env variables in one run:

  ```bash
  docker run --rm \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  containrrr/watchtower \
  --run-once ncam
  ```

* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

**Note:** We do not endorse the use of Watchtower as a solution to automated updates of existing Docker containers. In fact we generally discourage automated updates. However, this is a useful tool for one-time manual updates of containers where you have forgotten the original parameters. In the long term, we highly recommend using [Docker Compose](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/docker-compose).

### Image Update Notifications - Diun (Docker Image Update Notifier)

* We recommend [Diun](https://crazymax.dev/diun/) for update notifications. Other tools that automatically update containers unattended are not recommended or supported.

## Building locally

If you want to make local modifications to these images for development purposes or just to customize the logic:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chris230291/docker-ncam.git
cd docker-ncam
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm/v7,linux/arm64 \
  --no-cache \
  --pull \
  -t chris230291/ncam:latest .
```

The ARM variants can be built on x86_64 hardware using `multiarch/qemu-user-static`

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register --reset
```
